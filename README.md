VGM extraction tools
====================

Some tools to extract MIDI and 4-op FM voices from [.VGM files](https://vgmrips.net/wiki/VGM_File_Format).

vgm2opm
-------
Similar to Shiru's vgm2opm, it extracts 4-op FM voices from vgm files. Unlike Shiru's vgm2opm, it supports more chips, such as the OPN\* series and OPM, and limited support for OPL\*. It uses roughly the same algorithm to compact duplicate voices.
